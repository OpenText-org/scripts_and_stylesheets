# Various scripts and things from the OpenText.org project original annotation

* These are various XQuery, XSLT and other scripts that were used in the original OpenText.org annotation.

* They are posted here for historical and archive purposes **AS IS** and without any support or intention for modification etc.

* **N.B.** These scripts **are very old** and predate recent developments in web development and nice WEB2.0+ js libraries and frameworks etc. They were written starting in 1998 when you have to decide which browser to support etc etc. So don't expect them to work completely or at all in a modern browser!
